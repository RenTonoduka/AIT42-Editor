feat: complete system architecture design for AIT42 Editor

- Add comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview, components, data flow
- Add detailed COMPONENT_DESIGN.md with specs for all 6 crates
- Add CARGO_WORKSPACE.md with workspace structure and dependency management
- Add ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md as high-level overview
- Add README.md with project overview and documentation index

Architecture highlights:
- Rust + ratatui + crossterm for native TUI performance
- 6 workspace crates: core, tui, lsp, ait42, fs, config
- Event-driven architecture with tokio async runtime
- Rope-based text buffer for O(log n) operations
- LSP integration via tower-lsp
- AIT42 49 agents + Coordinator + Tmux session management

Design patterns:
- Command pattern for undoable operations
- Strategy pattern for modal editing
- Observer pattern for file watching
- Facade pattern for LSP integration
- Factory pattern for agent creation

Performance targets:
- Startup time: <500ms
- LSP completion: <100ms
- Memory (active): <200MB
- Render: 60 FPS (16ms per frame)

Status: Week 1-2 Design Phase COMPLETE
Next: Week 3-5 Core Implementation
